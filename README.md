This project was created to practice webscraping with node.js, puppeteer, and cheerio. The react app allows you to search for the current available shoes for sale on the nike website. The other portion allows you to purchase the shoes from the react application. 

** note: The application will not actually complete the transaction on nikes' website. This is not a bug, just not a feature I wanted to finish.

# Getting Started
Using react scripts you can run:
### `npm start`
to start the react portion of the application.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

You will also need to start up the node.js server.
In order to do this navigate in the `server` directory
From there you can run:
### `node index.js`
to start the node.js server
